## Description

The Autonomous Web Scraper and Content Aggregator is a Python program that operates autonomously to scrape web content based on search queries. It utilizes the `requests` library to send HTTP requests, the `BeautifulSoup` library to extract relevant data from web pages, and various NLP tools like `spaCy` and HuggingFace small models for data extraction and analysis.

The program does not rely on hardcoding specific URLs, instead, it generates search queries based on user-defined topics or keywords using NLP algorithms from HuggingFace small models. It then autonomously performs web scraping by sending requests to search engines or specific websites based on the generated queries. The relevant information from the HTML response is extracted using `BeautifulSoup`.

After scraping the web, the program applies data extraction and pre-processing techniques to intelligently extract and clean the relevant data from the scraped web pages. It uses NLP tools like `spaCy` or HuggingFace small models for text cleaning, normalization, and entity recognition.

The program also serves as a content aggregator by aggregating the extracted data to create insightful and engaging content. It can generate summaries, create curated lists, extract key insights, or identify trends from the scraped data using NLP algorithms like text summarization or topic modeling.

Additionally, the program is equipped with content curation and publication capabilities. It autonomously curates and publishes the generated content on websites, blogs, or social media platforms. It can create blog posts, social media updates, or newsletters based on the aggregated data. The program also incorporates SEO techniques to optimize the content and improve search engine visibility.

To ensure the performance and effectiveness of the content, the program monitors the performance of the published content. This includes tracking engagement rates, traffic data, and user feedback. It leverages HuggingFace models for sentiment analysis to understand user sentiments about the content and make improvements accordingly.

## Role Responsibilities

1. Query Generation: The `QueryGenerator` class is responsible for autonomously generating search queries based on user-defined topics or keywords. It utilizes NLP algorithms, such as HuggingFace small models, to generate high-quality and contextually relevant search queries.

2. Web Scraping: The `WebScraper` class performs web scraping by sending requests to search engines or specific websites based on the generated queries. It utilizes the `requests` library for sending HTTP requests and the `BeautifulSoup` library for extracting relevant information from the HTML response.

3. Data Extraction and Pre-processing: The `DataExtractor` class intelligently extracts and pre-processes the relevant data from the scraped web pages. It applies text cleaning, normalization, and entity recognition techniques using NLP tools like `spaCy` or HuggingFace models.

4. Content Aggregation: The `ContentAggregator` class aggregates the extracted data to create insightful and engaging content. It can generate summaries, create curated lists, extract key insights, or identify trends from the scraped data using NLP algorithms like text summarization or topic modeling.

5. Content Curation and Publication: The `ContentPublisher` class autonomously curates and publishes the generated content on websites, blogs, or social media platforms. It creates blog posts, social media updates, or newsletters based on the aggregated data and incorporates SEO techniques to optimize the content for improved search engine visibility.

6. Performance Monitoring: The `PerformanceMonitoring` class monitors the performance of the published content. It tracks engagement rates, traffic data, and user feedback. It utilizes HuggingFace models for sentiment analysis to understand user sentiments about the content and make improvements accordingly.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/web-scraper.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd web-scraper
   ```

3. Install the required libraries and dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Import the necessary classes from the Python program:
   ```python
   from web_scraper import WebScrapingProgram
   ```

2. Instantiate the `WebScrapingProgram` class with a topic as an argument:
   ```python
   topic = "Python programming"
   program = WebScrapingProgram(topic)
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```python
   entities, topics, blog_post, social_media_updates, engagement_rates, traffic_data, user_sentiments = program.run_program()
   ```

4. Access the relevant information and data:
   ```python
   print("Entities:", entities)
   print("Topics:", topics)
   print("Blog Post:", blog_post)
   print("Social Media Updates:", social_media_updates)
   print("Engagement Rates:", engagement_rates)
   print("Traffic Data:", traffic_data)
   print("User Sentiments:", user_sentiments)
   ```
